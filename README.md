# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

House price prediction is a problem in the real estate industry to make informed decisions. 
By using machine learning algorithms we can predict the price of a house based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms and other relevant factors. 
In this project we will explore how to build a machine learning model in Python to predict house prices to gain valuable insights into the housing market.


#### Step 1: Import Libraries and Dataset
#### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
#### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
#### Step 4: Data Cleaning
#### Step 5: OneHotEncoder - For Label categorical features
#### Step 6: Splitting Dataset into Training and Testing
#### Step 7: Model Training and Accuracy

As we have to train the model to determine the continuous values, so we will be using these regression models.

- SVM-Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest Regressor
- Linear Regressor

And to calculate loss we will be using the mean_absolute_percentage_error module

#### Conlcusion: clearly SVM model is giving better accuracy as the mean absolute error is the least among all the other regressor models i.e. 0.16 approx.
To get much better results ensemble learning techniques like Bagging and Boosting can also be used.
